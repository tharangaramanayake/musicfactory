		<p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. The band was recently voted as the greatest artist of '00s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.</p>
		<p>Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album Minutes to Midnight (2007). The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their most recent work Living Things (2012) combines musical elements from all of their previous records. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others on Reanimation. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.</p>

		<p>Breaking Benjamin is an American alternative metal band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, currently consisting of Benjamin Burnley and Chad Szeliga. The band has released four studio albums, an EP, and a greatest hits album. The band took an indefinite hiatus due to frontman Burnley's recurring illnesses and inability to tour in mid-2010. Further complications arose in August 2011, when Mark Klepaski and Aaron Fink were fired from the band.</p>
		<p>In 1998, Burnley, guitarist Aaron Fink, Nick Hoover and Chris Lightcap formed Breaking Benjamin. Burnley later moved to California to experiment musically. When he moved back to Pennsylvania, he started a band called Plan 9, playing guitar and singing alongside drummer Jeremy Hummel and bassist Jason Davoli,[2] the latter of which was subsequently replaced by Jonathan "Bug" Price. Plan 9 occasionally opened for Lifer at home shows. During one show, Burnley said, "Thank you, we're Breaking Benjamin", reclaiming the name from earlier in 1998.</p>

		<p>3 Doors Down is an American rock band from Escatawpa, Mississippi who formed in 1996. The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass) and Matt Roberts (guitar). They took in Chris Henderson in the very early days of The Better Life's creation and released the album as a 4 piece band. Richard Liles played drums for the band during their touring stint on that record. From 2002 - 2005 The band hired Daniel Adair as a "touring" drummer and took off to play nearly 1000 shows as this formation all across the world in support of their hugely successful 'Away From The Sun' album. In 2005, when Daniel Adair was hired full-time by Nickelback, 3 Doors Down took on Greg Upchurch (Puddle Of Mudd) to play drums full-time. In 2012; the band released a statement explaining an issue with original guitarist Matt Roberts' health, leading to his departure from 3 Doors Down to take time away from the busy life of being a rockstar. This movement created space for Chet Roberts to fill. Roberts was Chris Henderson's guitar tech previously.</p>
